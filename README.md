# YOLO-V3 Object Tracker

This repository contains a Python script that implements object detection using YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) and tracks the detected objects in real-time using a webcam or video stream.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- NumPy (`pip install numpy`)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/skmirajulislam/YOLO-V3-Object-Tracker.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd YOLO-V3-Object-Tracker
```

3. Run the Python script:

```bash
python object_tracker.py
```

## Install Dependencies

Before running the script, make sure you have installed the required dependencies:

1. YOLOv3 weights and configuration files can be downloaded from [here](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/).
2. OpenCV: You can install it via pip:
3. NumPy: You can install it via pip:

   

5. Adjust the parameters as needed:
   - `image_path`: Path to the image file if you want to perform object detection on an image.
   - `yolov3_weights`: Path to the YOLOv3 pre-trained weights file.
   - `yolov3_cfg`: Path to the YOLOv3 configuration file.
   - `min_confidence`: Minimum confidence threshold for detected objects.
   - `bbox_reduction_factor`: Adjusts the bounding box dimensions.
   
6. Press 'q' to quit the application.
